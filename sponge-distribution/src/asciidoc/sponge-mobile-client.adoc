:appName: Sponge Remote

== Introduction
{appName} is an open-source mobile application that provides a generic user interface to call remote {sponge} actions. It could be used as _the one app to rule them all_ for {sponge} services that publish actions via the {sponge} Remote API. All business logic has to be placed in {sponge} actions, so the only requirement to have the application working is to create your own {sponge} service by writing a knowledge base that define actions that will be visible and ready to run in the application or to connect to an existing {sponge} service.

The app is made with https://flutter.io[Flutter]. It can be run on both Android and iOS.

NOTE: {appName} is in alpha phase and supports only a limited set of {sponge} features.

The {appName} is especially useful when data and functionality are more important than visual aspects of a GUI, e.g. for prototyping, rapid application development, low cost solutions, etc. The reason is that the application provides only a generic and opinionated GUI whose customization is limited.

image::mobile_architecture.svg[title="The mobile application architecture",width=800]

Sponge Remote supports heterogeneous {sponge} services in a sense that each of the services can provide actions from a different scope (for example one for the MPD, the second for managing IoT device sensors, the third for image recognition etc.). All of the services have the same high level interface, but each of them can provide different low level interface.

One of many use cases of the application is to connect to IoT devices that have {sponge} installed and execute available actions. Different types of such devices provide different sets of actions that are specific to a device features. For example one device could have a camera and provide an action to take a picture. Another device could have a temperature sensor and provide its readings or have a machine learning model and provide predictions.

The {appName} uses several {sponge} concepts such as actions and action arguments metadata, data types metadata, action and data type features, annotated values, provided action arguments, categories and events. It supports a convention over configuration paradigm.

You could build a customized GUI using your own Flutter code that will call the same {sponge} actions as the {appName}, using the upcoming {sponge} Flutter API library.

Unless noted otherwise in the release notes, the {appName} and the {sponge} Flutter API library versions `0.minor.*` are compatible only with the {sponge}  versions `1.minor.*`, e.g. the `0.16.5` version of the {appName} will be compatible with the `1.16.1` version of the {sponge} engine.

The {appName} layout is optimized for smartphones.

NOTE: The {sponge} Flutter API library is in alpha phase and supports only a limited set of {sponge} features.

[[mobile-app-getting-started]]
== Getting started
To try some of {sponge} features you can connect to the Demo Service. However, to use the full potential of {sponge} and {appName} you should run a {sponge} application service in your local network.

For information on how to run a predefined {sponge} service (e.g. on Raspberry Pi) in Docker see link:/user-guide/#applications[Applications].

For information on how to run your own {sponge} service in Docker see link:/quickstart/#quickstart-docker-template[Remote Sponge service template].

== Functionalities
The following chapters show the key functionalities of the mobile application.

=== Navigation

image::screens/mobile/drawer.png[title="The navigation drawer",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

The navigation drawer allows switching between the main screens.

=== Connections

image::screens/mobile/actions_connection_list.png[title="Selecting a connection to the Sponge instance in the action list screen",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

You may configure many connections to {sponge} Remote API services. The application allows you to connect to a single service at the same time.

image::screens/mobile/connections.png[title="List of connections to Sponge instances",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

You may add, edit and remove connections to {sponge} instances as well as activate a connection. To remove a connection swipe the corresponding element.

image::screens/mobile/connections_edit.png[title="Editing a connection to a Sponge instance",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

A {sponge} address is the URL of the {sponge} instance.

The application can find nearby (i.e. located on the local network) {sponge} services.

=== Action list

image::screens/mobile/actions.png[title="The action list",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

The main screen shows the list of actions defined in the connected {sponge} engine. Only actions that have argument and result metadata are available. This is because the application uses a generic access to the actions utilizing their data types, labels, descriptions, features and so on. The number in the action icon is the number of action arguments.

To call an action or set action attributes tap the triangular icon on the right side of the action label.

The floating button allows to refresh the action list from the server. The refresh button clears all entered action arguments and received results.

NOTE: The application currently doesn't supports all {sponge} data types.

=== Action call
When an action call screen is displayed, provided arguments will be fetched from the server. If an action call screen for the same action has been displayed earlier and a provided argument has been modified by a user, that argument will be fetched again only if it has the _overwrite_ flag.

An action call screen can be closed by swiping right.

image::screens/mobile/action_call_manage_lcd.png[title="The action call that manages the Raspberry Pi LCD display",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

Actions may have read only, provided arguments to show data from the server (see the `Current LCD text` attribute). The `REFRESH` button retrieves the current values of such arguments manually.

image::screens/mobile/action_call_arg_depends.png[title="The action call that shows argument dependencies",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

Action arguments may depend on each other. Argument dependencies are supported in the action call panel and allow creating simple, interactive forms where some arguments are provided by the server, some entered by the user, some read only and some depend on the values of others. The important thing is that all that configuration is defined in an action in a knowledge base placed on the server side, not in the mobile application.

Actions may return a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] formatted text.

=== Events
The {appName} can subscribe to {sponge} events. The subscription uses a {sponge} gRPC service published on a default port (i.e. the Remote API port plus `1`). A user must have priviliges to subscribe to events and to send events.

There are a few places where {sponge} events are directly used in the application:

* An event list screen (handles events subscribed globally for the application).
* An action call screen for actions that have _refresh events_ configured (handles events subscribed locally for an action).

image::screens/mobile/actions_events.png[title="Event related actions",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

==== Event subscription
Events can be subscribed globally for the application. Subscription management is performed by a subscription action, i.e. an action that has the `intent` feature set to `subscription`. {sponge} provides a default subscription action `GrpcApiManageSubscription`.

In case of a new event an operating system notification will be displayed.

image::screens/mobile/event_subscription_management.png[title="Event subscription management",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

==== Event list
The event list screen shows all events the application has subscribed for but only those that has been sent when the application is running.

By tapping on an event the user will be directed to a screen presenting an action associated with this event. This action is called an _event handler action_ and is set up in the event type definition as a feature `handlerAction`. The action is required to have an `ObjectType` argument with object class `RemoteEvent`. An event instance will be passed to that argument. After the action is called, the event is automatically dismissed from the GUI.

If there is no event handler action defined for a specific event type, a default event handler action will be shown. The default action is searched by its `intent` feature which has to be `defaultEventHandler`. {sponge} provides a default event handler action `GrpcApiViewEvent`.

==== Action with refresh events
Every action can have _refresh events_ configured. When such an action is shown in the GUI, the application will subscribe to refresh events. When such event arrives, the action arguments will be automatically refreshed. Event arguments are ignored.

== Advanced use cases

=== Sub-actions
Sub-actions provide references to actions associated with a parent entity (e.g. a parent action, a record). A sub-action is represented by the `SubAction` class.

Sub-actions support argument and result substitutions.

.Sub-action properties
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Property |Description

|`name`
|A sub-action name.

|`label`
|A sub-action label.

|`description`
|A sub-action description.

|`List<SubActionArg> args`
|Sub-action argument substitutions. An argument substitution is represented by the `SubActionArg` class. It can be added using the following methods: `withArgs(List<SubActionArg> args)`, `withArg(SubActionArg arg)` and `withArg(String target, String source)`.

|`SubActionResult result`
|A sub-action result substitution. A result substitution is represented by the `SubActionResult` class. It can be added using the following methods: `withResult(SubActionResult result)` and `withResult(String target)`.

|`Map<String, Object> features`
|Sub-action features.
|===

.Argument substitution properties
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Property |Description

|`String target`
|A target attribute name (i.e. an argument name of a sub-action).

|`String source`
|A source attribute (i.e. an argument name of a parent entity).

|`Map<String, Object> features`
|Argument substitution features.
|===

.Result substitution properties
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Property |Description

|`String target`
|A target attribute for the result (i.e. a nargument name of a parent entity).

|`Map<String, Object> features`
|Result substitution features.
|===


.Substitution keywords
[cols="1,2,4"]
|===
|Keyword |Substitution |Description

|`@this`
|argument source
|In case of a sub-action for an action it is a record of all parent action arguments. In case of a record argument or a list element it is the value itself.

|`@this`
|result target
|It represents all action arguments or a whole record value or a list element. If a sub-action returns `null` and the result substitution is `@this`, the result will be ignored.

|`@index`
|argument source
|A list element index. Applies only for lists.

|`@parent`
|argument source
|A whole list for a list element sub-actions. Applies only for lists.

|`@parent`
|result target
|A whole list for a list element sub-actions. Applies only for lists.
|===

==== Argument substitution
A target argument must have the same type as a source value. A source argument name could be a path if a source value is a record, e.g. `"arg1.field1"`.

If a sub-action has any visible arguments, a new action call screen will be shown.

The sub-action related features are not propagated to a sub-action in an annotated value feature.

Sub-actions can use globally saved (in a mobile application) action arguments but only if there is no argument substitutions (i.e. there are no arguments passed from the main action). It is necessary to avoid inconsistency.

==== Result substitution
A sub-action result can be assigned to a parent action argument.

=== Context actions
Context actions are sub-actions that can be specified for an action, a record and a list element (see the list-details). Context actions should be specified as the `contextActions` feature statically for a type or an action or dynamically for an annotated value. The latter option takes precedence.

==== Argument substitution
If a context value is an annotated value, the screen will show a header containing a label of the annotated value.

==== Active or inactive context actions
Before showing a list of context actions the application checks (by connecting to the server) if the context actions are active. Inactive actions will be greyed out.

[source,python]
----
include::{rootDir}/sponge-app/sponge-app-demo-service/sponge/sponge_demo_forms_library_records.py[lines=5..-1]
----

The main action should have a list argument that is provided with the overwrite option. The action shouldn't be callable. The list argument type can be annotated and the provided list elements may have labels (`AnnotatedValue().withLabel()`) and descriptions. The list argument may have the following features: `createAction`, `readAction`, `updateAction`, `deleteAction`. Their values are the sub-action names that will be called to perform the CRUD operations.

There are two types of sub-actions: CRUD actions and context actions. CRUD actions implement _create_, _read_, _update_ and _delete_ operations. Context actions implement customized operations related to a list element.

The CRUD actions should not be visible in the actions list so they should have the `visible` feature set to `False`.

In the default scenario _read_, _update_ and _delete_ actions should have the first argument corresponding to the value of the list element. In most cases the argument `visible` feature should be set to `False` to hide it. Its type should be the same as the list element's type. The value of the list element will be passed as this argument. In the case of a _create_ action, no argument corresponding to any list element is necessary.

The result of a _create_, an _update_ and a _delete_ action is ignored and should be set to `withNoResult`.

After calling a CRUD action the main action arguments are refreshed.

A _create_ CRUD action has some limitations. It doesn't support argument substitutions and checking if the _create_ action is inactive.

=== Interactive form
An interactive form provides live update in a GUI and an instant modifications of a server state. It can be implemented by an action with provided and submittable arguments and action refresh events. Interactive forms can be used for example to manage IoT devices.

The following example shows a very simple MPD player implemented as a {sponge} action. A change in an MPD server state generates a {sponge} event. Such event is subscribed by the action in the mobile application and causes the action to refresh its arguments. On the other hand, a change made by a user in the GUI will cause such argument to be submitted to the server.

=== Geographical map
`ListType` elements can be shown on a geographical map if its list type has the `geoMap` feature configured.

Each list element that has the `geoPosition` feature will be displayed on the map. You can tap on an icon that represents an element to see the element label and its context actions.

If an action has only one argument which is a list with a geo map and the action has no buttons, the map will be displayed in a full action call screen. If a list with a geo map is an argument in an action that doesn't meet that criteria, the action call screen will display only a button for this argument. If the button is tapped a map screen will be shown.

If a list element has the `geoLayerName` feature that corresponds to a configured marker layer name, it will be assigned to that layer. If there is no marker layer configured, a default one with the `null` name will be created.

NOTE: The map functionality is experimental.

== Supported {sponge} concepts

=== Data types

==== `AnyType`
Not supported.

==== `BinaryType`
Partially supported.

Editing (as an action attribute) is supported only for a `image/png` mime type with the `drawing` characteristic feature. Viewing is supported for image formats supported by Flutter and other binary content supported by the https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/open_file[`open_file` Flutter plugin] that is used by the application.

Support for nullable values is limited.

==== `BooleanType`
Supported.

==== `DateTimeType`
Partially supported.

`DATE_TIME_ZONE` and `INSTANT` editing is not supported.

The default format for `DATE` is `"yyyy-dd-MM"`. A format for `TIME` is required for the {sponge} Remote API Dart client.

==== `DynamicType`
Partially supported. This functionality is considered experimental.

A new dynamic value can be created only on the server side, i.e. in an `onProvideArgs` action callback method. A provided `DynamicValue.type` name will be ignored because a name of a parent dynamic type is used in the application.

==== `IntegerType`
Supported.

==== `ListType`
Partially supported. This functionality is considered experimental.

A unique list with a provided element value set is represented as a multichoice widget. In most cases a complex list element should be annotated with a value label in order to be nicely displayed in the mobile GUI.

See the <<mobile-advanced-use-cases,Advanced use cases>> chapter.

Support for nullable values is limited.

==== `MapType`
Partially supported. This functionality is considered experimental.

Editing is not supported.

==== `NumberType`
Supported.

==== `ObjectType`
Partially supported. This functionality is considered experimental.

Supported only if an object type defines a companion type that is supported.

==== `RecordType`
Supported. This functionality is considered experimental.

==== `StreamType`
Not supported.

==== `StringType`
Supported.

A `StringType` value in a text field is always trimmed when the field is submitted and converted to `null` if it is empty. So for example you can't enter only white spaces in such text field if the type is not nullable.

==== `TypeType`
Not supported.

==== `VoidType`
Supported.

A https://material.io/components/chips/[`chip`] widget is presented as an editor. A user can tap the chip widget to submit an argument if it is configured as submittable.

=== Data type formats

.Supported data type formats
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Format |Description

|`phone`
|A phone number format. Applicable for `StringType`.

|`email`

|A URL format. Applicable for `StringType`.

|`console`
|A console format. Text is presented using a monospaced font. Applicable for `StringType`.

|`markdown`
|A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] format. Applicable for `StringType`.
|===

=== Provided action arguments

==== Non-limited value sets
A non-limited value set is supported only for `StringType`.

==== Submittable arguments with dependant arguments
If a provided argument is `submittable` with the `responsive` feature set to `true` and has other arguments that depend on it, not only those dependant arguments have to point to that argument but also:

* the submittable argument should have the `influences` property set to point to the dependant arguments,
* the dependant arguments should be provided with the `OPTIONAL` mode (`withOptionalMode()`).

|===

==== Widgets

.Supported widget types for the `widget` feature
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Widget |Description

|`slider`
|Supported for an `IntegerType` but only if it has min and max values defined. The default behaviour of a slider is lazy, i.e. a value is set on an end of drag. If an integer type has a `responsive` feature set to `true`, the value will be set while dragging.

|`switch`
|Supported for a `BooleanType`. The default widget for `BooleanType` is a checkbox.
|===

A data type property can be dynamically overwritten by a corresponding feature in an `AnnotatedValue`. The feature name has to be exactly the same as the data type property name. The overwrite is handled by the {appName}.

==== List pagination

.List pagination features
[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
|Feature |Type |Applies to |Description

|`pageable`
|`boolean`
|`ListType`
|If `True`, a list will be pageable. Defaults to `false`. A pageable list type has to be annotated, because values of offset, limit and count are passed by features in an annotated list value. A pageable list is assumed to have the `scroll` feature set to `true`.

|`offset`
|`int`
|`ListType` annotated value
|An offset of the first element of a page.

|`limit`
|`int`
|`ListType` annotated value
|A limit of a page, i.e. a maximum number of elements in a page.

|`count`
|`int`
|`ListType` annotated value
|A count of all available elements of a list. This value is optional.

|`indicatedIndex`
|`int`
|`ListType` annotated value
|An optional index of a single indicated element in a list. This feature is experimental and is implemented only for pageable lists with a limited functionality. If an element is indicated, the GUI will show a button enabling a user to jump to that element (but only if a page containing such element is already loaded from the server). Another limitation is that a jump resets a saved scroll position of a list. To use this feature in the application, you have to turn the application setting "_Use scrollable indexed list_" on.
|===

A pagination uses the `provideActionArgs` Remote API method. The features `offset` and `limit` have to be set when invoking `provideActionArgs`. A provided, annotated list must have the `offset` and the `limit` set and optionally the `count`. A client code is responsible for setting `offset` and `limit`. An action `onProvideArgs` callback method is not required to support `offset` or `limit` if they are not set in the request. A page size is established by a client code.

The pagination is supported only for primary (i.e. not nested) action arguments and only for read provided annotated lists.

The pagination works only _forward_, i.e. all previous list elements fetched from the server are stored in mobile device memory.

==== Geographical map
A geographical map feature is represented by the `GeoMap` class that contains layers as instances of `GeoLayer`:

* `GeoTileLayer` represents a tile layer,
* `GeoWmsLayer` represents a WMS layer,
* `GeoMarkerLayer` represents a marker layer,

A geographical position is represented by `GeoPosition`.

== Customized applications
Access to actions in the {appName} is generic. However you could build a customized GUI using your own Flutter code using the upcoming {sponge} Flutter API library.

=== {sponge} Digits
The {sponge} Digits mobile app is an example of using a customized Flutter UI with the {sponge} service to recognize handwritten digits.

image::screens/mobile/digits_drawing.png[title="The digit recognition - drawing a digit",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

The application allows drawing a digit that will be recognized by a {sponge} action. After each stroke the remote action call is made and the result is shown in the circle.

== Third party Dart/Flutter software
The {appName} and the {sponge} Flutter API library use third party software released under various open-source licenses. Besides the dependencies stated in the respective Flutter projects, the following components use modified versions of other open-source software:

* `AsyncPopupMenuButton` - a modified Flutter `PopupMenuButton` widget that adds support for an asynchronous item builder.
* `Painter` - a modified https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/painter2 library. It is used for drawings.
