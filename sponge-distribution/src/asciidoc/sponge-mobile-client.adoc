== Introduction
The {sponge} mobile client application is a https://flutter.io[Flutter] application that provides a generic GUI to call remote {sponge} actions. It can be run on both Android and iOS. It could be used as _the one app to rule them all_ for {sponge} services that publish actions via the {sponge} REST API. All business logic has to be placed in {sponge} actions, so the only requirement to have the application working is to create your own {sponge} service by writing a knowledge base that define actions that will be visible and ready to run in the application or to connect to an existing {sponge} service.

NOTE: The application is currently under development. It will be released as an open source.

The application is especially useful when data and functionality are more important than visual aspects of a GUI, e.g. for prototyping, rapid application development, low cost solutions, etc. The reason is that the application provides only a generic and opinionated GUI whose customization is limited.

image::mobile_architecture.svg[title="The mobile application architecture",width=800]

One of many use cases of the application is to connect to IoT devices that have {sponge} installed and execute available actions. Different types of such devices provide different sets of actions that are specific to a device features. For example one device could have a camera and provide an action to take a picture. Another device could have a temperature sensor and provide its readings or have a machine learning model and provide predictions.

The mobile application uses several {sponge} concepts such as actions and action arguments metadata, data types metadata, action and data type features, annotated values, provided action arguments, categories and events. It supports a convention over configuration paradigm.

You could build a customized GUI using your own Flutter code that will call the same {sponge} actions. In that case the generic {sponge} mobile client would be used as a Flutter library in your Flutter project.

== Functionalities
The following chapters show the key functionalities of the mobile application.

=== Connections

image::screens/mobile/actions_connection_list.jpg[title="Selecting a connection to the Sponge instance in the action list screen",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

You may configure many connections to {sponge} REST API services. The application allows you to connect to a single service at the same time.

image::screens/mobile/connections.jpg[title="List of connections to Sponge instances",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

You may add, edit and remove connections to {sponge} instances as well as activate a connection. To remove a connection swipe the corresponding element.

image::screens/mobile/connections_edit.jpg[title="Editing a connection to a Sponge instance",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

A {sponge} address is the URL of the {sponge} instance.

=== Action list

image::screens/mobile/actions.jpg[title="The action list",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

The main screen shows the list of actions defined in the connected {sponge} engine. Only actions that have argument and result metadata are available. This is because the application uses a generic access to the actions utilizing their data types, labels, descriptions, features and so on. The number in the action icon is the number of action arguments.

To call an action or set action attributes tap the triangular icon on the right side of the action label.

The floating button allows to refresh the action list from the server. The refresh button clears all entered action arguments and received results.

NOTE: The application currently doesn't supports all {sponge} data types.

=== Navigation

image::screens/mobile/drawer.jpg[title="The navigation drawer",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

The navigation drawer allows switching between the available main views.

=== Action call

image::screens/mobile/action_call_manage_lcd.jpg[title="The action call that manages the Raspberry Pi LCD display",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

Actions may have read only, provided arguments only to show a data from the server (see the `Current LCD text` attribute). The `REFRESH` button retrieves the current values of read only, provided arguments from the server.

image::screens/mobile/action_call_arg_depends.jpg[title="The action call that shows argument dependencies",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

Action arguments may depend on each other. Argument dependencies are supported in the action call panel and allow creating simple, interactive forms where some arguments are provided by the server, some entered by the user, some read only and some depend on the values of others. The important thing is that all that configuration is defined in an action in a knowledge base placed on the server side, not in the mobile application.

Actions may return a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] formatted text.

=== Events
The application can subscribe to {sponge} events. The subscription uses a {sponge} gRPC service published on a default port (i.e. the REST API port plus `1`). A user must have priviliges to subscribe to events and to send events.

There are a few places where {sponge} events are directly used in the application:

* An event list screen (handles events subscribed globally for the application).
* An action call screen for actions that have _refresh events_ configured (handles events subscribed locally for an action).

==== Event subscription
Events can be subscribed globally for the application. Subscription management is performed by a subscription action, i.e. an action that has the `intent` feature set to `subscription`. {sponge} provides a default subscription action `GrpcApiManageSubscription`.

In case of a new event an operating system notification will be displayed.

image::screens/mobile/event_subscription_management.jpg[title="Event subscription management",width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%]

==== Event list
The event list screen shows all events the application has subscribed for but only those that has been sent when the application is running.

By tapping on an event the user will be directed to a screen presenting an action associated with this event. This action is called an _event handler action_ and is set up in the event type definition as a feature `handlerAction`. The action is required to have an `ObjectType` argument with object class `RemoteEvent`. An event instance will be passed to that argument. After the action is called, the event is automatically dismissed from the GUI.

If there is no event handler action defined for a specific event type, a default event handler action will be shown. The default action is searched by its `intent` feature which has to be `defaultEventHandler`. {sponge} provides a default event handler action `GrpcApiViewEvent`.

==== Action with refresh events
Every action can have _refresh events_ configured. When such an action is shown in the GUI, the application will subscribe to refresh events. When such event arrives, the action arguments will be automatically refreshed. Event arguments are ignored.

==== Sending events
Events can be sent by the application using an action. {sponge} provides a default, generic action for sending events `GrpcApiSendEvent`.

== Advanced use cases

=== Context actions
Context actions can be specified for actions, record arguments and list elements (see the list-details) to provide related, customized sub-actions. Context actions should be specified as the `contextActions` feature statically for a type or an action or dynamically for an annotated value. The latter option takes precedence.

include::{completeExamplesProject}/sponge-examples-project-demo-service/sponge/sponge_demo_context_actions_action.py[lines=5..-1]
----

==== Arguments substitution
Modes of passing arguments to a context action:

* Default (e.g. `"ContextAction"`). In case of a context action for an action, all action arguments as a record (represented as a map) will be passed as the first argument of the context action. In case of a record argument or a list element, the record or the list element value will be passed as the first argument respectively.
* Explicit substitution (format `"ContextAction(targetArgName=sourceArgName,...)"`, e.g. `"ContextAction(contextArg1=arg1,contextArg2=arg2)"`). In case of a context action for an action, the argument `contextArg1` of the context action will be set to a value of the argument `arg1` of the parent action and the argument `contextArg2` of the context action will be set to a value of the argument `arg2`.
* Implicit substitution (format `"ContextAction(sourceArgName,...)"`, e.g. `"ContextAction(arg1)"`). In case of a context action for an action, the first argument of the context action will be set to a value of the argument `arg1` of the parent action.
* No arguments passed (e.g. `"ContextAction()"`).

The target argument must have the same type as the source value.

A source argument name could be a path if a source value is a record, e.g. `"ContextAction(contextArg1=arg1.field1)"`. The `this` keyword can be used as the source argument name. In case of a context action for an action it is a record of all parent action arguments. In case of a record argument or a list element it is the value itself.

If a context action has any visible arguments, a new action call screen will be shown. If a context value is an annotated value, the screen will show a header containing a label of the annotated value.

The context actions feature is not propagated to sub-actions in an annotated value feature.

Context actions can use globally saved (in a mobile application) action arguments but only if there is no argument substitutions (i.e. there are no arguments passed from the main action). It is necessary to avoid inconsistency.

==== Result substitution
A context action result can be assigned to a main action argument by using the notation `"parentArgName=ContextAction()"`. As a parent argument name you can use the `this` keyword which means all action arguments or all record value or a list element.

For list elements only the `this` keyword as a result substitution is supported.

If a context action returns `null` and the result substitution is `this`, the result will be ignored.

[source,python]

----

The main action should have a list argument that is provided with the overwrite option. The action shouldn't be callable. The list argument type can be annotated and the provided list elements may have labels (`AnnotatedValue().withLabel()`) and descriptions. The list argument may have the following features: `createAction`, `readAction`, `updateAction`, `deleteAction`. Their values are the sub-action names that will be called to perform the CRUD operations.

There are two types of sub-actions: CRUD actions and context actions. CRUD actions implement _create_, _read_, _update_ and _delete_ operations. Context actions implement customized operations related to a list element.

The CRUD actions should not be visible in the actions list so they should have the `visible` feature set to `False`.

In the default scenario _read_, _update_ and _delete_ actions should have the first argument corresponding to the value of the list element. In most cases the argument `visible` feature should be set to `False` to hide it. Its type should be the same as the list element's type. The value of the list element will be passed as this argument. In the case of a _create_ action, no argument corresponding to any list element is necessary.

The result of a _create_, an _update_ and a _delete_ action is ignored and should be set to `withNoResult`.

After calling a CRUD action the main action arguments are refreshed.

=== Interactive form
An interactive form provides live update in a GUI and an instant modifications of a server state. It can be implemented by an action with provided and submittable arguments and action refresh events. Interactive forms can be used for example to manage IoT devices.

The following example shows a very simple MPD player implemented as a {sponge} action. A change in an MPD server state generates a {sponge} event. Such event is subscribed by the action in the mobile application and causes the action to refresh its arguments. On the other hand, a change made by a user in the GUI will cause such argument to be submitted to the server.

|`ListType`
|A flag indicating that a list will have its own scroll. This feature turns off the main scroll in an action screen. It is useful for long lists. This feature is only supported for main action arguments (i.e. not nested).

==== Widgets

.Supported widget types for a `widget` feature
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Widget |Description

|`slider`
|Supported for an `IntegerType` but only if it has min and max values defined. The default behaviour of a slider is lazy, i.e. a value is set on an end of drag. If an integer type has a `responsive` feature set to `true`, the value will be set while dragging.

|`switch`
|Supported for a `BooleanType`. The default widget for `BooleanType` is a checkbox.
|===

A data type property can be dynamically overwritten by a corresponding feature in an `AnnotatedValue`. The feature name has to be exactly the same as the data type property name. The overwrite is handled by the {sponge} mobile client application.

==== List pagination

|Feature |Applies to |Description

|`pageable`
|`ListType`
|If `True`, a list will be pageable. Defaults to `false`. A pageable list type has to be annotated, because values of offset, limit and count are passed by features in an annotated list value.

|`offset`
|`ListType` annotated value
|An offset of the first element of a page.

|`limit`
|`ListType` annotated value
|A limit of a page, i.e. a maximum number of elements in a page.

|`count`
|`ListType` annotated value
|A count of all available elements of a list. This value is optional.
|===

A pagination uses the `provideActionArgs` REST API operation. The features `offset` and `limit` have to be set when invoking `provideActionArgs`. A provided, annotated list must have the `offset` and the `limit` set and optionally the `count`. A client code is responsible for setting `offset` and `limit`. An action `onProvideArgs` callback method is not required to support `offset` or `limit` if they are not set in the request. A page size is established by a client code.

The pagination is supported only for primary (i.e. not nested) action arguments and only for read provided annotated lists.

A pageable list should also have the feature `scroll` set to true. The pagination works only _forward_, i.e. all previous list elements fetched from the server are stored in mobile device memory.

== Included demos
The access to actions in the mobile application is generic. However the application may include demos that use a customized UI.

=== Handwritten digit recognition

If the current connection points to a {sponge} instance that has the required action that performs a handwritten digit recognition, this demo is enabled in the navigation drawer.

The digit recognition demo screen allows drawing a digit that will be recognized by the {sponge} action. After each stroke the remote action call is made and the result is shown in the circle.
