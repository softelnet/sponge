= TensorFlow
{sponge} provides integration with https://www.tensorflow.org[TensorFlow]. TensorFlow could be used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. The machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

Although there could be many ways of using TensorFlow from Java, this integration uses the https://www.py4j.org[Py4J] library wrapped in the Py4J plugin to communicate between a {sponge} Java process and a Python program running TensorFlow. The TensorFlow Python API has been chosen over the Java API, because, at the time of writing, the TensorFlow APIs in languages other than Python were not covered by the API stability promises. For use cases that require low latency times, the usage of Py4J may be insufficient. An alternative approach is to use https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/[TensorFlow serving], designed for production environments.

== The Digits recognition REST API service example
This example shows how to expose the TensorFlow machine learning model trained for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database[MNIST database] as a REST API service to recognize handwritten digits. For the complete source code see {sourcesUrl}/sponge-tensorflow. Please note that the Python language is used both in the {sponge} knowledge base (Jython version 2.7) and in the script running TensorFlow (CPython version 3).

.CPython prerequisites
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
# Install TensorFlow by following the guide https://www.tensorflow.org/install/, for example with Virtualenv and Python 3.
# Only the most important steps are presented hereunder.

virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/tensorflow
cd ~/tensorflow
source ./bin/activate

# Change directory to the Sponge source code main directory and install Python dependencies.
(tensorflow)$ pip3 install -r sponge-tensorflow/examples/tensorflow/digits/requirements.txt
(tensorflow)$ deactivate

|===
|File name |Description

|{sourcesUrl}/sponge-tensorflow/sponge-tensorflow/src/main/java/org/openksavi/sponge/tensorflow/ImageClassifierService.java[`ImageClassifierService.java`]
|The Java interface of the image classifier Python service. This interface is used by Py4J to expose Python functionality to a Java process.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/actions/digits_predict.py[`actions/digits_predict.py`]
|The {sponge} knowledge base that contains definitions of actions that will be exposed in the {sponge} REST API service. The `DigitsPredict` action takes a binary representation of a PNG file and passes it to the running Python script file by invoking `ImageClassifierService.predict(byte[] image)` method. This method will be invoked on the remote object running in the Python process.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/digits_rest_server.xml[`digits_rest_server.xml`]
|The {sponge} configuration file that instructs {sponge} to create the Py4J plugin, execute the Python script file that will load a TensorFlow model and start the REST API server.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/digits_rest_server.py[`digits_rest_server.py`]
|The main {sponge} knowledge base file (compatible with Jython) for that example.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/python/digits_model.py[`python/digits_model.py`]
|The Python script file (compatible with CPython) that defines the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network[ConvNet] model trained on the MNIST database to recognize handwritten digits. This example uses https://keras.io[Keras] neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/python/image_classifier_service.py[`python/image_classifier_service.py`]
|The Python script file (compatible with CPython) that loads the model. If the model file `data/digits_model.h5` exists, it will be loaded. Otherwise a new model will be trained and saved. This model is then used by the Python-based `ImageClassifierService` implementation that is exposed by the Python-side Py4J gateway.

|{tensorflowSourcesUrl}/digits/python/digits_model_create.py[`python/digits_model_create.py`]
|The auxiliary Python script file (compatible with CPython) that manually creates, trains and saves the model. It overrides the model file. Additionally the script plots the training and validation loss side by side, as well as the training and validation accuracy.

NOTE: The {sponge} REST API configuration used for this example is not secure. In the production environment you should use HTTPS as well as user authentication.
