= Knowledge bases
A knowledge base is used mainly to define processors. A knowledge base may be written in one of the supported scripting languages. An alternative way of defining knowledge bases is to write them directly in Java or Kotlin. However, using a scripting knowledge base has advantages such as that a modified script knowledge base doesn't need recompilation.

There is a global namespace for all processors, regardless of the knowledge base they are defined in. When there is more than one processor of the same name in the engine, only the last enabled one will be registered. However, you can't enable a processor if an another one that has the same name and is of a different type has already been enabled.

Scripting knowledge bases are read by interpreters. For every knowledge base there is one instance of an interpreter.

== Knowledge base file structure
Generally, script knowledge base files consist of a few parts:

. Import of modules and packages (from the scripting language or Java).
. Definitions of knowledge base processors (actions, filters, triggers, rules and correlators).
. Definitions of callback functions that will be invoked in particular situations.

== Callback functions

.Callback functions
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Function |Description

|`onInit()`
|Called once on the initialization of a knowledge base after the knowledge base files have been read.

|`onBeforeLoad()`
|Called just before `onLoad` and also every time a knowledge base is reloaded. The implementation could for example register data types before scanning processors.

|`onLoad()`
|Called on the loading of a knowledge base and also every time a knowledge base is reloaded. Before invoking an `onLoad` callback method, the engine scans to auto-enable processors (if this functionality is turned on). You may manually disable some of the auto enabled processors in this callback function if necessary.

|`onAfterLoad()`
|Called just after `onLoad` and also every time a knowledge base is reloaded.

|`onStartup()`
|Called once after the startup of the engine (after `onInit()` and initial `onLoad()`).

|`boolean onRun()`
|Called just after an `onStartup()` callback function. If this function returns `true` for every knowledge base, then the engine will start its threads and perform an endless loop in order to process events. This is the default behavior. Otherwise, the engine will assume a run once mode and it will invoke a shutdown without starting an event processing. The latter option allows a user to, for example, just run a script and stop the engine. It could be useful when using a standalone application to perform simple, synchronized tasks. In case of scripting knowledge bases `onRun()` may return `null` which will be treated as if it returned `true`.

|`onShutdown()`
|Called once before the shutdown of the engine.

|`onBeforeReload()`
|Called before every reloading of the knowledge base.

|`onAfterReload()`
|Called after every reloading of the knowledge base.
|===

{sponge} follows a convention that the names of all callback functions and methods start with `on`, e.g. `onStartup` for a knowledge base or `onConfigure` for a processor.

WARNING: You shouldn't place more than one callback function that has the same name in the same knowledge base (event in different files of that knowledge base). If there is more than one callback function that has the same name in the same knowledge base *only the last loaded function will be invoked*. Furthermore it could depend on the specific scripting language.

When {sponge} is starting, callback functions are invoked in the following order:

. executing all knowledge base files as scripts, i.e. executing the main body of the script files,
. `onInit()`,
. `onBeforeLoad()`,
. `onLoad()`,
. `onAfterLoad()`,
. `onStartup()`,
. `onRun()`.

Before `onStartup()` is invoked you will not be able to send events or access plugins. That is because the engine hasn't started fully yet.

When a knowledge base is reloaded, the callback functions are invoked in the following order:

. `onBeforeReload()` executed in the previous version of the reloaded knowledge base,
. executing all knowledge base files as scripts, i.e. executing the main body of the script files,
. `onBeforeLoad()` executed in the new version of the reloaded knowledge base,
. `onLoad()` executed in the new version of the reloaded knowledge base,
. `onAfterLoad()` executed in the new version of the reloaded knowledge base,
. `onAfterReload()` executed in the new version of the reloaded knowledge base.

== Global variables
The following predefined global variables are available in all knowledge bases.

.Global variables
[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Global variable |Description

|`sponge`
|The facade to the {sponge} engine operations that provides methods to send events, manually enable or disable event processors etc. This variable represents an instance of a Java class implementing `org.openksavi.sponge.kb.KnowledgeBaseEngineOperations`.
|===

For each plugin a global variable will be created. The name of this variable is the plugin name (i.e. the value configured as the plugin `name` attribute in the configuration).

== User variables
A user variable could be defined in one of the two scopes:

* the engine scope,
* the knowledge base scope.

=== Engine scope
The engine scope variables could be accessed in any knowledge base.

.The engine scope variable examples
[source,python]
----
sponge.setVariable("soundTheAlarm", AtomicBoolean(False))
sponge.getVariable("soundTheAlarm").set(True)
----

TIP: The engine scope is the same as a {sponge} internal session scope. This is because currently there is only one session per a single {sponge} engine instance.

=== Knowledge base scope
The knowledge base scope variables may be accessed only in the knowledge base they are defined in.

.The knowledge base scope variable examples
[source,python]
----
hearbeatEventEntry = None

def onStartup():
    global hearbeatEventEntry
    hearbeatEventEntry = sponge.event("heartbeat").sendAfter(100, 1000)
----

== Loading knowledge base files
The order of loading knowledge bases preserves the order specified in the configuration. Likewise the order of loading files of the same knowledge base preserves the order specified in the configuration.

A strategy of loading knowledge base files is provided by an instance of `KnowledgeBaseFileProvider`.

=== Default provider
The default provider is implemented by the `DefaultKnowledgeBaseFileProvider`.

Script knowledge base files are looked up in the file system as a relative or absolute path, then in the classpath, then in the file system relative to the XML configuration file parent directory and then in the file system relative to the {sponge} home directory. A knowledge base filename may contain wildcards (for files only, not directories), according to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob[glob pattern].

Wildcards are not supported for classpath resources by default.

This default behavior can be changed by providing a custom implementation of `KnowledgeBaseFileProvider` and passing it to the `setKnowledgeBaseFileProvider` method of the engine.

=== Spring based provider
The Spring based provider is implemented by the `SpringKnowledgeBaseFileProvider`. It will be automatically set if the `SpringEngineBuilder` is used. It additionally supports:

* the Spring `classpath*:` URL protocol for loading resources as well as other protocols supported by the Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/support/PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.html[`PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver`],
* the {sponge} `spar` URL protocol for loading script knowledge base files from JAR archives located in a filesystem.

The `spar` protocol name is an acronym for SPonge ARchive. The `spar` protocol accepts wildcards both in an archive content path and in an archive file path itself.

.Example of loading knowledge base files from a JAR archive using the `spar` protocol
[source,java]
----
SpongeEngine engine = SpringSpongeEngine.builder().knowledgeBase("kb", "spar:kb-archive.jar!/*.py").build();
----

== Loading knowledge base from an additional file
{sponge} gives the possibility to define a knowledge base in a few files. In order to do that, in the configuration file in the `<engine>` section you may define which files should be loaded by adding `<file>` tags to `<knowledgeBase>`. Additional files could also be loaded from a knowledge base level.

[source,python]
----
sponge.kb.load("triggers.py")
----

NOTE: If the same name is used for a new processor, the previous definition will be replaced with the new one. However, this behavior could depend on the specific scripting language.

== Reloading
Sometimes a situation may happen that there will be a need for a dynamic modification of processors, for example to add a new rule or modify an existing one. It is possible to do it without the need of shutting down and then starting the system again.

When variables are used in a knowledge base and you don't want them to be changed after reloading of the knowledge base, you should place their definitions in `onInit()` callback functions rather than simply in the main script or in `onLoad()`. That is because the main script and `onLoad()` are always executed during reloading but `onInit()` function is not.

When reloading the system, the configuration file is not loaded again. If the changes in this file (e.g. registering a new plugin) are to be visible in the system, the only way is to restart.

When the {sponge} engine is being reloaded, the previously defined processors will not be removed from the registry. When a processor definition has changed in the file being reloaded, it will be auto-enabled (i.e. registered) once more with the new definition. If auto-enable is off, then `sponge.enable` method must be invoked. In that case `sponge.enable` should be placed in the `onLoad()` callback function.

If auto-enable is on (this is the default setting), then all processors will be enabled after reloading, even processors that have been manually disabled before.

WARNING: There is a limitation in reloading a knowledge base that defines event set processors (i.e. rules or correlators). When there are existing instances of event set processors, they will be dismissed.

Depending on the specific interactions and taking into account differences in the third-party implementations of scripting languages, reloading sometimes may lead to problems or side effects and it should be used carefully. For example if `onLoad` callback function definition is removed in the Python script file before reloading, the instance of this function that had been loaded before will still be present in the interpreter and will be invoked. That is because the scripts being reloaded run in the same interpreter instance.

=== The `clearOnReload` flag
A scripting knowledge base can have the `clearOnReload` flag set. This flag indicates if the knowledge base should be cleared on reload. Defaults to `false`. If the knowledge base is to be cleared on reload, then all existing processors registered in this knowledge base will be disabled and a new interpreter will be created and attached to the knowledge base.

WARNING: Setting the `clearOnReload` to `true` can be potentially dangerous for the consistency of the knowledge base, especially if there are event processors. So make sure that your knowledge base will not be affected by this flag.

== Use of many knowledge base files
As mentioned before, {sponge} provides the possibility to read a knowledge base from many files. Dividing a knowledge base into a few files allows in an easy way to separate some functionalities.

The order in which the files are loaded is important. The files will be loaded in such order in which they were placed in the configuration.

== Synchronization of processes in a knowledge base
{sponge} is a multi-threaded system. {sponge} engine operations are thread-safe. However, attention should be paid that processors defined in a knowledge base access any shared resources in a thread-safe way. This could be achieved in various ways using Java or scripting language mechanisms.

== Non script knowledge bases

Non script knowledge bases may be written in Java or Kotlin. Non script base processor classes follow the naming convention JAction, JTrigger, JKnowledgeBase etc for Java and KAction, KTrigger, KKnowledgeBase etc for Kotlin.

=== Java knowledge bases

.Example of sending events from within a Java knowledge base
[source,java]
----
public class TestKnowledgeBase extends JKnowledgeBase { // <1>

    public static class TestTrigger extends JTrigger { // <2>

        @Override
        public void onConfigure() {
            withEvent("e1");
        }

        @Override
        public void onRun(Event event) {
            getLogger().debug("Run");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onStartup() {
        getSponge().event("e1").set("mark", 1).sendAfter(1000); // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> The definition of the Java-based knowledge base class.
<2> The definition of the Java trigger.
<3> Makes an event of type (name) `e1` with an attribute `mark` set to `1` and schedules it to be sent after `1` second.

=== Kotlin knowledge bases
Kotlin-based knowledge bases are currently supported only as non script knowledge bases.

.Example of a Kotlin knowledge base
[source,kotlin]
----
class Filters : KKnowledgeBase() {

    class ColorFilter : KFilter() {
        override fun onConfigure() {
            withEvent("e1")
        }
        override fun onAccept(event: Event): Boolean {
            logger.debug("Received event {}", event)
            val color: String? = event.get("color", null)
            if (color == null || color != "blue") {
                logger.debug("rejected")
                return false
            } else {
                logger.debug("accepted")
                return true
            }
        }
    }

    class ColorTrigger : KTrigger() {
        override fun onConfigure() {
            withEvent("e1")
        }
        override fun onRun(event: Event) {
            logger.debug("Received event {}", event)
        }
    }

    override fun onStartup() {
        sponge.event("e1").send()
        sponge.event("e1").set("color", "red").send()
        sponge.event("e1").set("color", "blue").send()
    }
}
----

In Kotlin knowledge bases there is no global variable `sponge`. Instead you have to use the `sponge` property.

See more examples of Kotlin-based knowledge bases in the `sponge-kotlin` project.

== Scripting knowledge bases interoperability
There are some limitation in the interoperability between scripting knowledge bases:

* You shouldn't pass knowledge base interpreter scope variables from one knowledge base to an another. Even if they are written in the same scripting language. This is because each knowledge base has its own instance of an interpreter.
* Data structures used for communicating between different knowledge bases should by rather Java types or simple types that would be handled smoothly by Java implementations of scripting languages. For example you shouldn't use a script-based plugin in knowledge bases other than the one in which this plugin has been defined.
* Using more than one knowledge base written in the same scripting language may, in certain situations, also cause problems, due to the internal implementations of scripting language interpreters.

== Predefined knowledge base libraries
{sponge} provides a few predefined script files that may be used as one of files in your compatible (i.e. written in the same language) knowledge bases. For example you may use the Jython library in your XML configuration file: `<file>classpath*:org/openksavi/sponge/jython/jython_library.py</file>`. The `classpath*` notation is available only for Spring aware engines and allows to use Ant style (`*`) specifications for directories and files.

== Knowledge base artifacts
Knowledge bases artifacts provide selected functionalities that can be used in your projects ad hoc. They are intended for more advanced cases than the predefined knowledge base libraries.

A knowledge base artifact can be written in only one scripting language. It can be used as a part of a bigger knowledge base, but other script files must be written in the same language.

=== Usage

[discrete]
==== Embedded

.Maven dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openksavi.sponge</groupId>
    <artifactId>[ArtifactId]</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.Sponge configuration
[source,xml]
----
<knowledgeBase ...>
    <file>classpath*:sponge/[Name]/**/*.py</file>
</knowledgeBase>
----

For example `<file>classpath*:sponge/mpd-mpc/**/*.py</file>`.

[discrete]
==== Standalone commadline application
If a knowledge base artifact is included in the standalone commadline application, add the following entry to your {sponge} configuration.

.Sponge configuration
[source,xml]
----
<knowledgeBase ...>
    <file>classpath*:sponge/[Name]/**/*.py</file>
</knowledgeBase>
----

Otherwise add the following entry.

.Sponge configuration
[source,xml]
----
<knowledgeBase ...>
    <file>spar:[ArtifactId]-*.jar!/**/*.py</file>
</knowledgeBase>
----

For example `<file>spar:sponge-kb-mpd-mpc-\*.jar!/\*\*/\*.py</file>`, where the `sponge-kb-mpd-mpc-*.jar` is a file in the filesystem.

== Knowledge base versioning
You may specify a version number for a knowledge base as an integer. It could be useful for example to enforce version checking when calling actions via the Remote API. You should set the version in the `onLoad` callback function. After editing the knowledge base file and before reloading the engine, you could increase the version number.

.Example of setting the knowledge base version.
[source,python]
----
def onLoad():
    sponge.kb.version = 1
----

== Naming conventions
The builder-style methods in the metadata classes follow the naming convention `with<Property>`, e.g. `BinaryType().withMimeType("image/png")`.

== Categories
Processors may be assigned to registered categories. Categories could be used in a client code to group processors independently of knowledge bases. This feature can be useful if you don't want to group processor by knowledge bases which requires more resources because each knowledge base has its own interpreter.

A registered category can be manually assigned to a processor in the processor configuration callback method `onConfigure` or dynamically by selecting processors that are to assigned to the category. The latter option could assign for example all processors defined in several knowledge bases to a single category in one line. Dynamic selection overwrites manual assigning.

NOTE: The dynamic selection of processors is supported only for actions, filters and triggers. It is not supported for event set processors.

.Example of registering categories and dynamically selecting processor categories by knowledge bases.
[source,python]
----
def onInit():
    sponge.addCategories(CategoryMeta("basic").withLabel("Basic"), CategoryMeta("extra").withLabel("Extra"))

def onLoad():
    sponge.selectCategory("basic", lambda processor: processor.kb.name in ("demo", "engine"))
    sponge.selectCategory("extra", ProcessorType.ACTION, lambda processor: processor.kb.name in ("demoExtra"))
----

.Example of manually assigning a processor to a category in a processor configuration.
[source,python]
----
class MyAction1(Action):
    def onConfigure(self):
        self.withLabel("MyAction 1").withCategory("myActions")
    def onCall(self, text):
        return None

== Extending Java-based processors and plugins in non-Java knowledge bases
Processors and plugins defined in non-Java languages can extend respectively Java-based processors and Java-based plugins. However this functionality is limited in different scripting languages.
