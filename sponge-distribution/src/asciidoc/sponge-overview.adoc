== {sponge}
*{sponge} is an open-source, Java-based action and event processing service with a mobile client application.*

This documentation applies to version {projectVersion} (release date: {projectDate}).

{sponge} is a software product for implementing *synchronous actions* and *asynchronous event processors*. Event processors listen to certain events and perform specified operations when some conditions are met. Events are usually sent by external systems. {sponge} allows to introduce temporal and logical conditions to processed events. Event processing may end up with sending of another, high-level event thus creating a hierarchical model of events. The supported event processors include *filters*, *triggers*, *rules* and *correlators*.

There are several ways to use {sponge}:

* *Embed* {sponge} as a software library in your *Java application* using Maven dependency.
* Download the {sponge} *standalone command-line program* and use it in your environment.
* Run the {sponge} *standalone command-line program in a Docker* container.
* Connect to a {sponge} service via the *Remote API*.
* Connect to a {sponge} service via the *Sponge Remote mobile application* (_currently in alpha phase_) or a custom mobile app build with the *Sponge Flutter API* (_currently in alpha phase_).

Actions and event processors are grouped in knowledge bases. A knowledge base is defined in files which may be written in one of several supported scripting languages, i.e. *Python*, *Ruby*, *Groovy*, *JavaScript* as well as in *Java* or *Kotlin*.

In some aspects {sponge} may be classified as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing[Complex Event Processing].

{sponge} requires Java 1.8 or above.

== Features
The main features of {sponge}:

* Provides a concurrent processing of *actions* and incoming *events*.
* Allows generating and scheduling of events (e.g. supports *cron* notation).
* Events may represent such diverse entities as, for example, *SNMP* traps, *RSS* feeds or *MIDI* messages.
* Allows *embedding in a custom Java application* (using Maven) or could be used as a *standalone command-line application*.
* Supports connecting to many types of external systems by using *http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel] integration*.
* Provides *own Apache Camel component* for including {sponge} engine in a Camel route.
* Provides plugins for integration with *Spring*, *Camel*, *CPython*, *MIDI* and *Raspberry Pi*.
* Supports creation of *custom plugins*.
* Supports *deployment in enterprise environments* by integration with Spring framework.
* The standalone command-line application allows, for example, *management of Camel routes without the need of writing Java code* (you may use any of the supported scripting languages or XML).
* Supports *reloading of knowledge bases on the fly* (i.e. while the system is running).
* Supports processing of streams of {sponge} events by using *http://reactivex.io[Reactive Extensions (ReactiveX)]*.
* Allows *publishing a custom Remote API of your application or your microservice as a set of actions (e.g. written in a scripting language) that may be changed and reloaded on the fly*.
* Provides *Remote API client libraries* for *Java* and *Dart* to simplify writing a client code.
* Provides integration with *https://www.tensorflow.org[TensorFlow]*, an open source *machine learning* framework. You may use the TensorFlow or Keras Python API indirectly from your Java application.
* Provides *Sponge Remote* (_currently in alpha phase_), a *generic, minimalistic, opinionated mobile application* backed by a server-side business logic. The business logic is placed in {sponge} actions. Sponge Remote provides a generic GUI to call those actions. Sponge Remote could be useful in cases when a mobile GUI doesn't have to be customized.
* Allows *development of mobile applications* using the *Sponge Flutter API* library (_currently in alpha phase_) for cases when the GUI that connects to {sponge} has to be customized.
* Provides a comprehensive documentation and many examples.

== Applications
{sponge} could be used as a component in various types of applications. Here are some examples.

Task automation::
Tasks could be programmed in any of the supported scripting languages as {sponge} actions, published via the Remote API and called or managed *remotely in the Sponge Remote mobile client application*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things[Internet of Things (IoT)]::
{sponge} as a part of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)#IoT_Modular_Gateway[an IoT gateway] can locally process data provided by the devices in the field, thus only important data is sent to the central node where data is collected, stored and manipulated by enterprise applications.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing[Edge computing] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing[fog computing]::
{sponge} may be used on edge devices (also known as smart devices), providing a computation platform that would be largely or completely performed on distributed device nodes. The requirement is that such device must have Java (JRE) installed. The example is Raspberry Pi with connected sensors.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[Minimum viable product (MVP)]::
The Sponge Remote mobile app (or a custom mobile app build with the Sponge Flutter API) along with {sponge} services can be used as an early version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_activity_monitoring[Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)]::
{sponge} embedded in a Spring based application may have an access to a service layer via Spring beans. {sponge} could periodically run monitoring tasks and generate notification events if necessary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_management[Fault management]::
{sponge} may be used to process faults or events sent by the network using a protocol such as SNMP. The processing may include creating issues into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system[the issue tracking system (Trouble Ticket system)]. {sponge} may use all protocols supported by Apache Camel or provided by custom plugins.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring[Network monitoring]::
{sponge} may be used to monitor a web server by periodically sending an HTTP request to fetch a page. It may also provide more advanced checks by running for example http://www.seleniumhq.org[Selenium] scripts to verify a web application. When a problem is detected {sponge} could send an email to the administrator.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA[Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)]::
{sponge} may be used as a part of Alarm handling as well as a part of a module that connects to the remote terminal units (RTUs) or the field sensors and actuators.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_control_system[Distributed control system (DCS)]::
{sponge} may be used as a part of the production control level to provide an event-driven monitoring.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration[System integration]::
{sponge} may be used to provide a script-based integration using Apache Camel routes. {sponge} could be connected to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus[the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)] as well.

Learning scripting languages::
{sponge} with the Sponge Remote mobile app can aid in learning scripting languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, Groovy) or make it more fun. That is because {sponge} action arguments and results can be managed in the mobile app GUI.

== Users
The potential users of an embedded {sponge} are Java developers.

The potential users of a standalone command-line {sponge} application are:

* Java, Python, Ruby, Groovy and JavaScript developers,
* DevOps engineers and system administrators with programming skills.

Because of {sponge} is a Java-based solution, at least basic knowledge of Java is suggested. It becomes important when browsing Javadoc API, using Java libraries, analyzing exception stack traces, etc. Moreover, to effectively use {sponge} for problems that require integration, a knowledge of Apache Camel becomes important.

The {sponge} mobile client application is intended for end users with no programming knowledge required.

== License
{sponge} is released under the https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache 2.0 license].

== Considerations

* Because of {sponge} doesn't introduce its own notation for knowledge bases, it provides a shorter learning curve for users that are familiar with one of the supported scripting languages. However it could lack more sophisticated features and could be less optimized for certain uses than other solutions. For example you specify event conditions by writing any code in a scripting language that is to be executed when a matching event happens. On one hand it gives you a flexibility and on the other hand it doesn't provide optimizations that could be possible if, for example, a strict temporal reasoning notation is used.
* {sponge} doesn't provide persistence of events out of the box.
