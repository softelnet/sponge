== 1.17.2 (not released yet)
* The Remote API JSON-RPC 2.0 error response data is now represented as a map. The previous, optional `detailedErrorMessage` field is now an optional entry in the map with the `detailedErrorMessage` key.
* The stateless `ErrorResponseProvider` in the Remote API has been changed to the stateful `RemoteApiErrorHandler` to provide more flexibility.
* Added a new `openApiDocsForGetVerbOperations` property to the Remote API settings. The flag specifies if the Open API specification should also contain GET operations. Defaults to `false`.
* Added a new `openApiOperationIdSuffixForGetVerbOperations` property to the Remote API settings - a suffix for an Open API operation ID for GET operations.
* Added a new `openApiDocsForEndpoints` property to the Remote API settings - a regexp specifying which endpoints should be included in the Open API specification.
* Added a new `includeErrorLocationInErrorMessage` property to the Remote API settings. The flag specifies if an error response message should contain an error location. Defaults to `false`.
* Added a new flag `allowFetchActionMetadataInActionCall` to the Remote API client. The flag allows fetching action metadata from the server before an action call (if not already cached). Defaults to `true`.
* Dependencies upgrade.

== 1.17.1 (2021-05-11)
* Added a new `copyHttpRequestHeaders` property to the Remote API settings. The flag indicates if the HTTP request headers should be copied to the HTTP response. Defaults to `false`.

This change resulted in a major refactoring of the server side (`sponge-remote-api-server`) and some adjustments of the client side (`sponge-remote-api-client`). The API concepts were clarified in the documentation. The `securityServiceClass` setting has been removed and the `securityProviderClass` setting should be used instead.

It makes easier creating a generic UI for an action call that reads and presents the actual state of the entities that are to be changed by the action and its arguments.
* Added a new REST API operation `actionArgs` that fetches the provided action arguments from the server.
* API change: The action calling methods, e.g. `EngineOperations.call(String actionName, Object... args)` have been changed to `EngineOperations.call(String actionName, List<Object> args)` and `EngineOperations.call(String actionName)`.
