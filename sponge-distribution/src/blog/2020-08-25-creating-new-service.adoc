= Creating a New Service with Sponge and the Sponge Remote Mobile App
:page-layout: post
:page-author: Marcin Pa≈õ

If you are not familiar with *Sponge* and the *Sponge Remote* mobile app, please read the {homepage}/2020/08/14/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Sponge and the Sponge Remote Mobile App] first.

After reading this article *you will learn*:

* How to *run* a *new Sponge service* in Docker using the Sponge service *template*.
* How to *create and modify Sponge actions* using a *git repository*.
* How to *reload* Sponge actions using the *Sponge Remote* mobile app.

== What you need

* About 15 minutes.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[*Docker*] installed on your computer and familiarity with Docker.
* An easy way to create a new *public git repository* (e.g. on GitHub). _Only a public git repository is allowed because currently git credentials are not supported in the Sponge service template._
* An *Android* phone or tablet with an Internet connection.
* Basic programming knowledge (Python, Groovy, Ruby or JavaScript).

== Introduction
It is important to know that this article *showcases only one way of creating a Sponge service* and knowledge base files, that is convenient for *knowledge base developers*. In most cases you shouldn't load knowledge base files from a git repository (particularly in production).

A *knowledge base* is used here merely to *define actions*. A knowledge base can be written in one of the supported scripting languages.

== Run a new Sponge service in Docker using the Sponge service template
To *run a new Sponge service in Docker* just type the following command, but place *your computer IP address* instead of `YOUR_COMPUTER_IP`. The address will be published by the *service discovery* in order to enable finding nearby Sponge services in your local network by the Sponge Remote mobile app. How to get your computer IP depends on the operating system.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
docker run -it --rm -p 1836:1836 -p 1837:1837 openksavi/sponge -c services/remote/remote.xml \
-Dsponge.remoteApiServer.serviceDiscoveryUrl="YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:1836"\
-Dsponge.serviceDir=examples/standalone/remote_service
----

* The `remote.xml` *configuration file* defines Sponge knowledge bases with support for knowledge base files stored in a *git repository*.
* The optional `sponge.serviceDir` property points to the directory containing local knowledge base files. The knowledge base files in the `examples/standalone/remote_service` directory define only one action: `Hello world`.

== Open the Sponge Remote mobile app and connect to your Sponge service
Open the *Sponge Remote mobile app* on your Android device and navigate to the *Connections* page.

There are two ways to add new connections:

* By *service discovery* - select the `Find new nearby services` menu item. If your service is found, tap it to connect. _Keep in mind that in some environments the service discovery may not work in Docker or would require additional configuration._
* By *creating a connection manually* - tap the *plus sign* icon, fill in the *connection name*, *Sponge address* and tap the `OK` button.
+

In the the *Connections* page tap the new connection to *activate* it. You are navigated back to the *Actions* page.

You can see only one action (`Hello world`) in the `MY SERVICE` tab. That action has been read from the local knowledge base files provided by the `sponge.serviceDir` property.

== Create the git repository
For the purpose of this article you need to *create a new public git repository*, e.g. on GitHub.

The repository should contain the `kb` directory that will be loaded by Sponge. You should place all your knowledge base files in this directory. _The name `kb` is only a matter of convention assumed in the `remote.xml` configuration file._

As a starting point you can *https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo[fork] the example git repository https://github.com/mnpas/sponge_example_git_kb*.

== Set up the git repository in Sponge
In the Sponge Remote mobile app navigate to the `ADMINISTRATION` tab and *tap the `Setup git knowledge base` action*.

image::blog/02_110_actions_administration.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

The `Setup git knowledge base` action clones the git repository and reloads the knowledge bases.

WARNING: Prior to setting a git repository as a Sponge knowledge base *you SHOULD verify its source codes*. When Sponge reads knowledge base files it simply executes them using the respective interpreter. Although in this case the execution will take place in a Docker container, generally it could be dangerous.

*Fill in the git repository URL and optionally the branch name.*

image::blog/02_120_action_git.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

*To run the action tap the `RUN` button.*

== Actions in the git repository
Now, in the `MY SERVICE` tab, *you can also see the Sponge actions defined in the knowledge base files located in the git repository* (names starting with `Hello world git`).

image::blog/02_130_action_my_services_git.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

== Modify an action
Launch your favourite IDE.

* *Clone* the git repository containing the knowledge base files - the one that you've just created.
* *Edit* one of the script files. For example, in the `kb/services.py` file:
** change the action label from `"Hello world git - Python"` to `"My Hello world git - Python"`,
** change the `onCall` method result from `"Hello World! Hello {}!"` to `"Hello {}!"`.
+
[source,python]
----
class HelloWorldActionPython(Action):
    def onConfigure(self):
        self.withLabel(
            "My Hello world git - Python").withDescription("Returns a greeting text.")
        self.withArg(StringType("name").withLabel(
            "Your name").withDescription("Type your name."))
        self.withResult(StringType().withLabel(
            "Greeting").withDescription("The greeting text."))
        self.withFeature("icon", "git")

    def onCall(self, name):
        return "Hello {}!".format(name)
----
* *Commit and push* the changes.
* *Run the `Reload Sponge knowledge bases` action* by tapping it in the Sponge Remote mobile app.

After going through these steps, you will notice that *the action label has changed in the mobile app instantly*.

image::blog/02_140_action_my_services_git_changed_action.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

== Create a new action
Now let's *create a new action*:

* *Create a new Python file* `my_service.py` in the `kb` directory.
+
[source,python]
----
class OsGetDiskSpaceInfo(Action):
    def onConfigure(self):
        self.withLabel("Get disk space info").withDescription("Returns the disk space info.")
        self.withNoArgs().withResult(StringType().withFormat("console").withLabel("Disk space info"))
        self.withFeature("icon", "console")
    def onCall(self):
        return sponge.process("df", "-h").outputAsString().run().outputString
----
* *Add the file to your git repository, commit and push* your changes.
* *Run the `Reload Sponge knowledge bases` action* by tapping it in the Sponge Remote mobile app.

Now you will notice *a new action with the label `Get disk space info`* in the *Actions* page in the mobile app.

image::blog/02_150_actions_new_action.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

*Tap the `Get disk space info` action in order to run it.*

image::blog/02_160_actions_new_action_called.png[width=300,pdfwidth=35%,scaledwidth=35%,align="center"]

The action result is *the output of the `df -h` command* that has been run in the Docker container. *Tap the shortened result text* to see the whole output.

== How does it work?
To understand how it works let's take a look at the *Sponge configuration file* `remote.xml`. For the brevity of this article, only the key settings are shown here.

            <file required="false">file:${sponge.workDir}/_local_git_cached/kb/**/*.js</file>
        </knowledgeBase>

        <!-- ... -->
    </knowledgeBases>

    <!-- ... -->
</sponge>
----

There are four knowledge bases for your service (`servicePython`, `serviceGroovy`, `serviceRuby` and `serviceJavaScript`), each for one of the supported scripting languages. The reason for that is to allow you to experiment with any of the supported languages.

Sponge allows only *one language for one knowledge base*. For each knowledge base a new instance of a corresponding interpreter is created and held in the memory.

The `clearOnReload` flag indicates that during reloading of knowledge bases, all previously registered processors (including actions) will be removed from the Sponge engine. Setting this flag to `true` is useful when experimenting with the knowledge bases.

The `_local_git_cached` directory *points to a local clone of the git repository that you have already set up*. *That's why you can see the actions defined in your git repository in your Sponge Remote mobile app.*

To see the full configuration file, go to https://github.com/softelnet/sponge/blob/master/sponge-standalone-app/services/remote/remote.xml[the Sponge repository on GitHub].

== Summary
Congratulations! Now you are familiar with *running your own Sponge service* and know how to *write your own Sponge actions*.

<<<<<<< HEAD
However the even more interesting journey begins with *using Sponge services to help you with some of your daily activities*. For example the predefined {sponge} *Music Player Daemon (MPD) Service* provides a basic set of actions that enable you to *use the Sponge Remote mobile app as a remote music player*. So, I encourage you to read other articles about Sponge.
